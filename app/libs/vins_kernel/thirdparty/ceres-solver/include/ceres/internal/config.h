// Default (empty) configuration options for Ceres.
//
// IMPORTANT: Most users of Ceres will not use this file, when
//            compiling Ceres with CMake, CMake will configure a new
//            config.h with the currently selected Ceres compile
//            options in <BUILD_DIR>/config, which will be added to
//            the include path for compilation, and installed with the
//            public Ceres headers.  However, for some users of Ceres
//            who compile without CMake (Android), this file ensures
//            that Ceres will compile, with the user either specifying
//            manually the Ceres compile options, or passing them
//            directly through the compiler.
